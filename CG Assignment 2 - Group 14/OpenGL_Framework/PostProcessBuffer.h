 // Post Process Buffer //

This class is for creating a double buffer for our post processing effects.
By using 2 framebuffers together, we can prevent the issue of trying to
read and write to the same framebuffer at the same time. Doing so can cause
artifacts, especially for effects that rely on sampling from an adjacent pixel!
Such artifacts are caused from the GPU not computing every single fragment at
the same time. This means that certain fragments may read from the buffer,
and overwrite the pixel in the buffer before other fragments have started.

The solution is to write to a different buffer than the one being read. In
order to chain multiple post processing effects together, the buffers being
read and drawn to must be swapped after each fullscreen quad draw call.
The purpose of this class is to simplify that! For each post processing effect,
we already know that there will be certain events EVERY time, so if we put them
inside a single function, this can clean up our code SIGNIFICANTLY, and make it
super easy to add additional effects, and even toggle certain effects on and off
for efficiency purposes! (There's no point in drawing an effect if it doesn't
have an impact on the screen)
By putting the draw call and swap functions together, this prevents the risk of
forgetting steps for specific effects, which could waste countless hours of
debugging why a certain effect isn't showing up.

I'm personally speaking from experience for that last one :P

IMPORTANT: This PostProcess class assumes that the shaders read from the
framebuffer from GL_TEXTURE0. If you require a shader to bind the scene to
a different slot, you would need to add a variable that determines what
slot the read framebuffer is binded to, and use that in place of 0.
